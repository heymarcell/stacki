# Stacki

Visual Builder for Astro.

A Mac & Windows desktop app for editing [Astro](https://astro.build) projects visually.

MIT licensed — fork it, build on it, ship your own version.

## Features

- **Pages** — browse every page in `src/pages`, create new pages (including nested routes like `blog/post-1`), and delete pages.
- **Layouts** — choose which layout from `src/layouts` wraps each page, and edit the layout's props (e.g. `title`).
- **Components** — every component in `src/components` appears in the palette. Drag one into the page structure (or double-click to append), drag to reorder, click ✕ to remove.
- **Props** — the props panel reads each component's `interface Props` / `Astro.props` destructure and generates typed fields (text, number, checkbox). Defaults are shown as placeholders.
- **Live preview** — the app runs `astro dev` for the opened project and embeds it. Edits are auto-saved (300 ms debounce), so Astro's hot reload updates the preview as you type.
- **Git & GitHub** — the branch chip in the title bar shows the current branch and dirty state. From its dropdown you can switch branches, create branches, commit, push, or publish a brand-new repo to GitHub (via the `gh` CLI).
- **Tell an AI what's selected** — **⇧⌘C** copies whatever the canvas has selected as the trail of `file:line-range` pointers that leads to it: the page, each component drilled into on the way down, then the node itself. Paste that into Claude Code or any AI chat that can read the project and it knows exactly which markup you mean.
- **Let an AI see what's selected (MCP)** — Stacki runs a small read-only [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
  server, so Claude Code, Cursor or any MCP client can ask what you have selected on the canvas, where it is
  in source, and what it actually looks like. See [Connecting an AI agent](#connecting-an-ai-agent-mcp).
- **Code fallback** — pages with markup too complex for the visual model open in a code editor instead, still with live preview.
- **New project** — "New Project…" scaffolds a minimal Astro starter (layout + 5 components + home page) and runs `npm install` for you.

## Running in development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts Vite (renderer hot reload) and launches Electron against it.

To run against a production build of the UI:

```bash
npm start
```

## Packaging installers

If you're building for yourself or from a fork, use the unsigned build — it
needs no Apple Developer account and no certificates:

```bash
npm run dist:mac:unsigned   # .dmg + .zip, no signing (build on macOS)
npm run dist:win            # NSIS installer (build on Windows)
```

Output lands in `release/`. macOS will warn the first time you open an
unsigned build; right-click the app and choose Open to get past Gatekeeper.

The signed variants are for maintainers with the release certificates:

```bash
npm run dist:mac   # requires a Developer ID cert + notarization credentials
```

## Releases

Official builds are published by CI, not from anyone's laptop. Pushing a
`v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds a signed and
notarized macOS universal build plus a Windows installer, uploads them to
the `stacki-releases` repo, and only makes the release visible once both
platforms have landed. Shipped apps auto-update from that feed via
`electron-updater`.

Signing and notarization credentials live in GitHub Actions secrets. They
are never in this repository, and GitHub does not expose them to workflows
triggered from forks — so a fork can build and run everything here, but
cannot produce a build signed with the official identity. That's intended.

If you fork this and publish your own builds, change `build.appId` and
`build.publish` in `package.json` to your own identifiers so your releases
don't collide with the official update feed.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. A few notes:

- `npm run dev` is all you need for day-to-day work — no credentials required.
- Please don't add workflows that use `pull_request_target`, or any workflow
  that exposes secrets to code from a fork.
- Report security issues privately to the maintainer rather than opening a
  public issue.

## Connecting an AI agent (MCP)

Stacki exposes what it is showing over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io),
so a coding agent can stop guessing which element you mean.

The split is deliberate:

> **Stacki is the eyes. Your agent is the brain and the hands.**

There are exactly two tools, both read-only:

| Tool | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `get_context` | What is selected: the page and breakpoint on screen, the tag, the rendered classes, the box and spacing, the essential computed styles, and the `file:line` trail that leads to it through every component drilled into on the way down. |
| `capture` | A picture of it: the selected element (the selected copy of a repeated node, scrolled into view, with Stacki's own outlines hidden) or the whole preview viewport. |

Nothing here edits your project. Your agent keeps using its normal file tools;
Stacki just tells it what you are pointing at and what the result looks like.

Stacki does not have to be the window you are looking at — a capture taken while
it sits behind your terminal is the current render, not the last one you saw.
(One exception: while Stacki is *minimised*, the previewed page renders in a
frame the OS has stopped drawing, so the picture may be older than the page.
`capture` says so when that happens.)

### The endpoint

    http://127.0.0.1:43821/mcp

It binds to loopback only, validates `Host` and `Origin` (so a web page cannot
reach it by resolving its own domain to 127.0.0.1), sends no CORS headers, and
requires a bearer token. The token is generated once and stored in Stacki's own
application-support directory — never in your project, never in git.

`STACKI_MCP_PORT` moves the port; `STACKI_MCP=off` turns the server off. If the
port is taken, Stacki says so rather than quietly moving somewhere else.

### Connecting

**File ▸ AI Connection (MCP)…** shows whether the server is running, the
endpoint, and a ready-made config for Claude Code or Cursor with the token
filled in. Copy it from there rather than typing it — and don't commit it.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user stacki \
  http://127.0.0.1:43821/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Cursor — `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stacki": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:43821/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Both are shown at user/global scope on purpose: Stacki switches between
projects, and the endpoint does not.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ and npm (the app shells out to `npm install` / `astro dev` for opened projects)
- `git` for version control features
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`), authenticated via `gh auth login`, for "Publish to GitHub"

## How editing works

Pages are parsed into a simple model: optional layout wrapper + a flat list of
self-closing component instances with props. The editor writes that model back
as clean `.astro` source. Pages containing arbitrary HTML, expressions, or
nested children fall back to the built-in code editor — nothing is ever
rewritten destructively.
