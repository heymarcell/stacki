// Two kinds of table, because there are two ways a set of variables can be the
// same thing more than once (see electron/cssVars.js):
//
//   modes    one rule per column — a light theme, a dark one, a brand one —
//            with the variable names down the side. What you want to see is
//            one name across all of them at once, which is a row.
//   matrix   one rule, but names that share their endings: `--h1-line-height`
//            and `--text-small-line-height` are one property of two things. The
//            things are the columns and the properties are the rows.
//
// Anything that is neither is a plain list, which is the same table with one
// column. A value that is only a reference to another variable shows that
// variable's name rather than its own text, because that is what was written
// and what the author would go looking for.
