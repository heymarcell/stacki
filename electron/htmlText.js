// the row as `&copy;`, the Content field offered `&#160;` to edit, and both were
// showing the source's spelling of a character rather than the character. An
// editor over a rendered page has to say what the page says.
//
// So a text node holds the characters, and the file keeps its own spelling: an
// untouched node is written back exactly as it was found (the writer has the
// original to hand), and one that has been edited is written as its characters,
// with the three that would otherwise be markup put back into entities.

// The named entities that turn up in hand-written markup. Not the full HTML
// table — that is 2231 names, nearly all of them for characters nobody types —
// but everything an author reaches for, plus the five that are structural.

// A no-break space looks exactly like a space and is not one — the file lies,

// U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER ARE NOT LIKE THAT,

// file says `🧑‍🚀` and the page shows one astronaut; write the joiner as
// `&#8205;` and the file says three things where the page shows one. THAT is
// the lie. A live dogfood watched `🧑‍🚀` in an untouched heading become
// `🧑&#8205;🚀` and filed it as a defect, correctly. The same applies to every
// other joined sequence: family emoji, flags, skin-tone modifiers, Indic
// conjuncts, and the ZWNJ that keeps Persian and Hindi words from ligating.
