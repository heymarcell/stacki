// Reading a conflicted file, and putting it back together.
//
// When a merge clashes, git writes the file with both versions in it, marked:
//
//     unchanged text
//     <<<<<<< HEAD
//     this branch's version
//     =======
//     the incoming version
//     >>>>>>> other-branch
//     more unchanged text
//
// Everything outside the markers is text both sides agree on. Everything
// inside is one disagreement — and a file can have several, which is the whole
// reason this exists: a page where the heading should come from one branch and
// the footer from the other is completely ordinary, and "keep the whole file
// from one side or the other" cannot express it.
//
// Git decides where the disagreements are, not this code. Two edits closer
// than a few lines come back as a single one, because git could not tell them
// apart either; that is a limit of the merge, not something to work around
// here.
//
// Parsing markers rather than diffing the two versions ourselves means the
// three-way merge is git's — with the common ancestor it alone has — and this
// only has to read the result.

// Longest-common-subsequence line diff, used to break one of git's conflicts
// into the separate decisions it really contains.
//
// Git groups edits that are close together into a single conflict, because its
// merge works in regions rather than in lines. So a page where the heading was
// changed on one branch and the paragraph on the other arrives as ONE choice
// covering both — and no answer to it is right: either side loses an edit, and
// "both" duplicates the heading AND the paragraph.
//
// Comparing the two sides line by line separates them again. The lines they
// agree on stop being part of the choice, and each run they disagree on
// becomes a decision of its own.
